    "Everyone loves pizza - New Yorkers in particular. Since 1905, pizza has been an integral part of the culture of New York, with over 400 pizzerias in the city as of 2010 [1]. With a population of over 8 million people, there is a pizza restaurant to serve roughly every 20,000 citizens [2]. Despite the prevailing assumption that there is a pizzeria on every corner, I believe there is still opportunity to successfully start a new one today. Selecting the right location is going to be very important - it does not make sense to open a new restaurant in a neighborhood which is already saturated with pizzerias. The goal of this project is to select a neighborhood in New York City which is underserved by pizza restaurants as a potential opportunity to open a new restaurant. Using neighborhood information from NYU's Spatial Data Repository and Restaurant location data from Foursquare, I will build a heatmap of pizza restaurants by neighborhood across New York City.\n",
